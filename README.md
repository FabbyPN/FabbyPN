- 👋 Hi, I’m @FabbyPN
- Throughout the years growing up I've always been on a computer. Middle school and high school I learned very little information and learned how to do my own website.  Finally decided I can do something in this industry and wanted to begin with coding. 
- 
When I'm not on the computer, I'm either going out hiking with my dog or I'm out with friends eating out at new restaurants. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I possibly can. Currently enroled in a course to start from the beginning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, MySQL, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything in the near future. Hopefully something in the gaming industry in the near future. 
- 📫 How to reach me is by my Linkdin, Twitter, and Discord.
